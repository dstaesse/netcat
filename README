Netcat with Ouroboros support.

Modified from the GNU netcat project:

    http://netcat.sourceforge.net/

This version requires Ouroboros to be installed:

    https://ouroboros.rocks

Ouroboros-netcat instructions:

 Clone the repo (somewhere):

    git clone https://github.com:dstaesse/netcat
    cd netcat

 To compile this Ouroboros version:

    LIBS=-louroboros-dev ./configure

 Or, to enable debugging output (the netcat -d flag):

    LIBS=-louroboros-dev ./configure --enable-debug=yes

 And give it a simple "make" command:

    make

 Ouroboros support is toggled with the -O flag.

 To start netcat in Ouroboros listen mode (assuming you are in the src/ folder):

    ./netcat -Ol

 To send some data to the netcat instance:

    ./netcat -Oc <name>

 Brief example over the "local" IPCP (you may need up to 3 terminal windows).

  #start the irmd

    sudo irmd --stdout

  #create a "local" IPCP.

    irm ipcp bootstrap type local name local layer local

  # register the netcat name in the local layer

    irm register name nc layer local        (Ouroboros version < 0.17)
    irm name register nc layer local        (be branch / upcoming version 0.17)

  # bind the netcat program to <name>

    irm bind prog ./netcat

  # start an Ouroboros listen server (with some verbosity)

    ./netcat -Ovvl

  # and from another terminal, send it a couple of bytes:

    echo "Here's Johnny!" | ./netcat -Oc nc

  # if all went well, you should see the following output on the server side

    [dstaesse@heteropoda src]$ ./netcat -Ovvl
    Flow received (new fd=64)
    Here's Johnny!
    ^CExiting.
    Total received bytes: 15
    Total sent bytes: 0

  # Stay curious.

Netcat is a featured networking utility which reads and writes data across
network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol.
It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly or
easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a
feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create
almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting
built-in capabilities.

This file will be written soon or late...
